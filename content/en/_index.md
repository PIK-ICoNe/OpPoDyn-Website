  <!-- Long title of the Project -->
  <p class="lead mt-5">
    OpPoDyn is a BMWK funded project that develops a state of the art simulation tool for networked dynamical systems
    and power grids using the <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia programming language</a>. It is built on prior work on NetworkDynamics.jl and PowerDynamics.jl:
    While NetworkDynamics.jl provides a fast backend for solving general DAE problems defined on a graph topology using solvers from <a href=https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl>DifferentaialEquations.jl</a>, PowerDynamics.jl provides additional tools specifically tailored towars power grid modeling.

<!-------------------------------------- Main Goals of the project  ---------------------------------------------------->

<!-- sets the colour of the section. In this case "primary" -->
{{% blocks/lead color="primary" %}}
  ## Main Project Goals
  
  OpPoDyn aims to provide an extensible framework for dynamic simulation of power grids both in RMS and EMT time domain.
  We aim at providing tools to easily implement and test your own models, control strategies and test scenarios without compromises in performance, instead of purely relying on built-in models and fault scenarios.
  As such, PowerDynamics.jl is especially suited for testing of new control algorithms, big ensemble studies, sensitivity analysis and parameter optimization.
