## Workshop Goals
{.text-center}

The aim of our project is to provide a tool that meets the needs of the research community. To learn more details about what we intend to build, and to share your most pressing and interesting use cases with us, we invite you to our 
*first online workshop on 29th of August 2024*.

We will give a short update on our project and our goals. But most importantly we're interested in hearing about how you would use our software, and what features you would need to make it useful to you.

As part of the project, we also plan to directly support teams that are building on our software. If you think this might apply to you, this workshop will also be an excellent starting point.
