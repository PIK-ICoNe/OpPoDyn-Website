## 4. E-Mail Contact
### 4.1 Description and Scope of Data Processing

Contact through various email addresses (e.g. oppodyn@pik-potsdam.de) is possible. In this case the personal data of the email sender transmitted via email shall be recorded. In this connection there will be no disclosure of data to third parties. The data shall exclusively be used for the processing of conversation.

### 4.2 Legal Basis and Purpose of the Processing

The legal basis for the processing of data transmitted within the course of forwarding an email is Art. 6 (1) (f) EU GDPR, i.e. the contact via email. Is the email contact aimed at concluding a contract, then an additional legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) EU GDPR.

Purpose of the processing is the correspondence with you.

### 4.3 Duration of Data Recording

Insofar as we do no longer need your data in order to handle your request, your personal data will be deleted. This is the case, as a rule, at the end of the conversation with you unless it can be inferred from the circumstances that the specific facts have not been finally clarified (e.g. in case of continued handling of your request or to clarify potential conflicts).

### 4.4. Requirement to provide Data

The provision of such data is neither legally nor contractually prescribed and required. However, we need such data to communicate with you. Under certain circumstances the failure to provide such data can ensue that we are unable to communicate with you any further. However, you will not incur any legal disadvantages from such non-provision unless indicated otherwise.
