## Sections

The various sections and how they can be changed.


### About

The "About" section presents a summary of the project. It is currently populated by text taken from the [PIK website]
(https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/output/projects/all/1005). 
__the formatting needs to be changed from centered to justified__


### Benchmarks

> [!NOTE] 
> This section is currently empty and inactive


### Blog (Section Title: News)

This section houses the Announcements and Releases subsections. 

#### News (Subsection Title: Announcements)

You can use this section to create News posts. 
There are two types of posts, those with images and those without. 
Example of a post with an image can be found in: ./how_to_guide/post_with_images_example folder
Example of a post without an image can be found in ./how_to_guide/post_without_images_example.md

In general the most important parts are the title, date and description. 
The **title** determines what appears on the page under the Announcements subsection. 
The **date** determines when the post was made. If a post has a future date, it will not appear until the data has come.

A very basic post can be seen under /content/en/blog/news/1st_online_workshop.md

> [!TIP] Entries with future dates will not appear in the page until the date is reached


#### Releases

You can use this section to create new Release Announcements. The same rules apply as in the news section.
